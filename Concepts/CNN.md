in cnn is always a matrix 3*3, multiply every element of the matrix and add them together to get the convolution at one point

digit word lens , when u focus a camera on any forigin langage on it recognise digits e.g letters A which is grid of numbers first take out convolution filters assuming already learnt , black rep -ve and white rep +ve in a 3*# matrix -ve -1 -1 0 +ve 1 2 1 , multiplying by 3*3 matrix product which shows red the -ve and green the +ve --- i.e the result of first kernal

2nd kernal scan it through 3*3 part of the matrix to get red or green asssuming two filters

next step add a nonlineraity relu to throw away the negeatives

layer 4 max pool replace by 2 *2 part of grid replace by maximum same thing but half the size

again repeat the same process

input ---layer + - -------= relu----maxpool ---repeat = and compare it with a templet A,B,C,C,D and see which closely matches

multiply by 4 * 8 matrix and add and coverted to giv perc prob

single lable --- softmax

multilabel --sigmoid
