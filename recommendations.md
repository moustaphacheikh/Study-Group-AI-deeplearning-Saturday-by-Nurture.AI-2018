Yesterday Kate did a post with the question: "Do you know some sources where I can find uncleaned data to get hands- on practice with data cleaning and preprocessing?" 

As data scientists we care about extracting the best information out of our data. Data is the new soil, you have to get in and get your hands dirty, without cleaning and preparing it, it just useless.

Cleaning and preparing is the most time-consuming and least enjoyable data science task, but one of the most important ones. No one can start a data science, machine learning or data driven solution without being sure that the data that they’ll be consuming is at its optimal stage.

Even though almost all data in the industry is "dirty", most of the data we use to practice and study is not in this state, so the problem of cleaning data become a bigger one when you have to wait to get a job to practice that. 

To help you get started and understand what is "dirty data" this is some data to practice:

[https://lnkd.in/eAw7MgJ
[https://lnkd.in/e24-bcr
[https://lnkd.in/egqAGKt

I recommend that you clean this data with my package Optimus.

A lioness hired a data scientist (fox) to help find her prey. 

The fox had access to a rich #DataWarehouse, which consisted of data about the jungle, its creatures and events happening in the jungle.

On its first day, the fox presented lioness with a report summarizing where all she found her prey in the last six months, which helped lioness decide where to go hunting next. This is an example of #DescriptiveAnalytics.

Next, the fox estimated the probability of finding a given prey at a certain place and time, using advanced ML techniques. This is #PredictiveAnalytics. Also, it identified routes in the jungle for the lioness to take to minimize her efforts in finding her prey. This is an example of #Optimization.

Finally, based on above models, the fox got trenches dug at various points in the jungle so that the prey got caught automatically. This is #Automation.

Descriptive Analytics -> Predictive Analytics / Optimization -> Automation. This is the #AnalyticsLifeCycle.
