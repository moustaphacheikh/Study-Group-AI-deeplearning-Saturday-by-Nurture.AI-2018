The Control Systems' guidance of the Space Shuttle for docking to Space Station or satellite is simply using the traditional AI Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) after all. There's no big data or deep-learning algorithm training involved at all, just simply human crafted fuzzy-rules in the knowledge-base, designed by both the expert system engineer & domain expert.

My main tool for designing Expert FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) is the Matlab Fuzzy Logic toolbox : https://lnkd.in/gDuKJBx which it can be used alone on it's own or it is integrated with other MathWorks toolboxes like the Simulink : https://lnkd.in/dryNn_n, Signal Processing : https://lnkd.in/fX2hA7B, Control System : https://lnkd.in/fhBFHHB, Statistics/Machine-Learning :  https://lnkd.in/fN_GPvr, Neural-Network/Deep-Learning : https://lnkd.in/fpubvNT & more, depending on how many toolboxes a user licensed to.

There're many publications on the use of Fuzzy Controller guidance for space vehicle docking, but here's a NASA paper on a design using Matlab:

Once I gather all the required rules in designing a FIS, then I can whip up the rule system in Matlab Rule Editor in less than an hour.
