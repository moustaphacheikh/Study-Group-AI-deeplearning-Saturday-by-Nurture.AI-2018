Session 1: Practical Deep Learning

Using the free and proven Fast.ai materials, this is perfect for beginners in deep learning and machine learning, with some prior Python programming experience and high school math knowledge – and it’d get you to a stage where you can implement cutting-edge deep learning models, in just 14 weeks! No worries if you have no Python programming experience, feel free to reach out and we’d be happy to advise on what you can use in the weeks leading up to the start date to prepare – you can certainly get up to speed if you work hard in these few weeks, but time is running short so get started now!

We will watch the lectures as a group, stop the video for discussion at any point if anyone has a question, and also breakout into small groups for the in-lecture exercises – removing any obstacles along the way, making sure that you can progress through the course confidently if you stick with us – that’s our commitment to you for your time investment!

Session 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Covering the material in Stanford’s CS231n Spring 2017 course headed by Prof Fei-Fei Li (Chief AI Scientist of Google Cloud, Director of Stanford AI Lab). This session will cover topics like image classification, object detection, image caption, visual question answering, feature visualisation and adversarial training.
