How to get started with Deep Learning for Data Science? 

So, this is one of the posts I was mentioning earlier. Deep Learning is so important right now. It's not just adding layers to a neural network, is a complex and interesting field with lots of space for research and development. 

It's not easy to get started but I'll try my best to guide you through this process. Check out this resources, but remember, this is not only watching videos and reading papers, it's about understanding, programming, coding, failing and then making it happen. 

-1. Learn Python and R ;)

0. Andrew Ng and Coursera (you know, he doesn't need an intro):

1. Siraj Raval: He's amazing. He has the power to explain hard concepts in a fun and easy way. Follow him on his YouTube channel. Specifically this playlists:
