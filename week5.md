***Note :***




1) The Wiki page will contain solution to most of the commonly faced problems. Kindly go through them before you ask any questions.




2) Please watch the videos well in advance and if possible one of the participants can summarize their understandings and findings during the Meetup (Contact me if Interested)




3) Do Sign up in Fast.ai forums (http://forums.fast.ai/) and AI Saturdays Forum (https://ai6forums.nurture.ai/)




4) Please post your questions on AI Saturdays Forum as discussed in General Channel to get faster response.




5) Try to get some ideas/problems that you are interested to work on. Preferably with corresponding dataset.




6)For people who feel there are too many videos. Please watch as many Videos possible. You need not have 100% Understanding of the videos. Please note down the points that you are not clear.




7)Gist of the Videos  will be presented followed by a discussion. Administrative Stuff and other Generic Stuff (Introductions) can be fast forwarded at your ease. Do start with Fast.ai Video and try replicating the notebook without copying the code.
