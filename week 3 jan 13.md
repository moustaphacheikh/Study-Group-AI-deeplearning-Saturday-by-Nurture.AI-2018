In order to cater to a diverse audience, there will be 2 sessions every Saturday – you can attend both, 
one of them or none, it’s totally up to you! If you don’t want to attend the sessions, throughout the 
day there will be open hacking on creating open-source code implementations of the top research paper 
pre-prints that week. Or use that time to catch-up on lectures and readings (Afternoon sessions will be more
focused towards demo and hands on Coding !) while discussing with peers.

Link : [https://github.com/garythung/trashnet
Dataset Link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3P9oO5A3RvSUW9qTG11Ul83TEE

Use the Dataset-Resized.zip for the dataset.
Please Compare your performance with the authors performance. Write a Brief description about how you 
did it ? Task 2 : Theory Questions

1) Similarity and Difference Between Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning?
2) What is Bias? How does it affect the performance of the model?
3) How does lr_find() work ? (If Interested)
