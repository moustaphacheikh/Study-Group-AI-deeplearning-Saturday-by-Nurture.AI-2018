Agenda for Upcoming Meetup :  (Might Change)

CS231n : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition: Revisited :

1 ) Introduction to Vision and Common Computer Vision Problems. :
2 ) Naive Approach to Build Images Classifier:
3 ) Loss Functions and Optimization : 
4 ) Introduction to Neural Networks : Back Propagation : 
5 ) Convolutional Neural Networks : 
6 ) Training Neural Networks : Activation functions, initialization, dropout, batch normalization

Hands on :

2 Layer Neural Network using Numpy : Without any Libraries and with Libraries like Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch
(1 or 2 of the frameworks)
